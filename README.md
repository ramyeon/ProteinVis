## Protein Visualizer
This is an augmented reality project demonstrating the way in which ligands interact with their target molecules. It was created in Unity 4.7.0f1 using Vuforia 5.0.10, and designed for use on Android devices. Users can point their camera at the image target (add link), then select a ligand to trigger the animation. The animation is intended to highlight the random nature of ligands bouncing around until they come into contact with the binding site of the target molecule, after which they will interact with the target to produce their intended effects.

## Installation
The latest .apk build is available to be pulled, and can then be transfered to an Android device and installed. This project can also be found on the Google Play store (soon). Pulling the complete project results in a directory which can be used as a Unity project.

## Models
All models were pulled from RSCB's Protein DataBank as PDB files. The large proteins were created in molecular Maya (a biological Maya toolkit) and processed in Blender before being imported into Unity. The ligands were created with UCSF ChimeraX before being imported to Blender for processing.

## Collaboration
This is a collaboration with Peter Rose at the RSCB Protein DataBank and Dr. Jurgen Schulze at UCSD. Peter came up with the original vision for the project, and all biological data and models were pulled from the RSCB PDB. Dr. Schulze aided with the implementation of the project, contributing to the design of various interactions and the user interface.
